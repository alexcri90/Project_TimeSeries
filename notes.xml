Arima Forecasts Efficient is the SARIMAX
We start on Thursday!

Please take a look at the project Architecture in order to understand what this project is about. Also, read very carefully the Notebook provided: it has all the information about everything I have done for this project. We need now to write a full report that explains the preliminary analysis and treatments of the time series and how we selected the three models for the prediction. Be careful! In the report we must NEVER say that we actually have the solution for the Time Series!

For this task we will adopt the following approach: you will write a full, descriptive text (complete with LaTex formulas) for each of the sections that I will provide you. These are the sections:

I need some text that I can easily just copy and paste. Sometimes you will ask and I will give you some of the produced plots, to produce a meaningful comment. WE WILL PROCEED STEP BY STEP, WITH VERY FEW SECTIONS AT A TIME. All text and LaTex formulas will be produced as an Artifact, in order for me to be able to paste it directly on Microsoft Word. Eventual LaTex formulas MUST BE PROPERLY RENDERED! If we cannot do it directly on Microsoft Word, please provide instructions on which tools should we use.
